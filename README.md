# Project:
RandoShop App
# Made by:
Me (no other contributors)
# What it does:
This app pulls information like the picture, title, and item description of an item, and displays them on a webpage. The information was pulled from [mockapi.io](https://www.mockapi.io)
# What I learned:
The most important skill of this project is pulling information from an api and displaying the information. I learned about routes and how to redirect the user and how components worked, since this project was made in the beginning of my react obesssion.
